# My Peak Navigator - MVP

My Peak Navigator is a showcase that was demonstrated at the Data Madness Meetup in Sep 2020. 

## Description

The core of this project is a Shiny application that enables users to filter for country, peak groups and an elevation range of peaks. The remaining peaks are visualized on an interactive map, plus a histogram.

## Motivation
The maturity of the Shiny app corresponds to an early mvp stage of a data product. The idea is not to show a full-fledged shiny app, but to encourage Data Scientists to visualize (preliminary) results in interactive dashboards to facilitate communication with stakeholders. 

## Code

This repository contains the R code of the R Shiny application.

## Shiny App

The Shiny app is available on shinyapps.io: [Peak Navigator](https://synsugar.shinyapps.io/Peak_Visualization/)
